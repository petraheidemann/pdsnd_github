### Description
This program is written in Python and uses Pandas library to explore data related to bike share systems in three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

- The most common month, day of week, and start hour for bike rides.
- The most common start and end station as well as the most frequent combination of start and end stations
- Total and average duration of the trips
